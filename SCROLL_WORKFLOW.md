# ScrollWM Quick Workflow Guide

This is a practical, first‑session guide for Scroll. It assumes the default keymap in this image (Alt as Mod, vim movement).

## 5‑Minute Starter Routine

1) Open a few apps: terminal (`Mod+Return`) and launcher (`Mod+Space`).
2) Move focus with `Mod+h/j/k/l`.
3) Rearrange windows with `Mod+Ctrl+h/j/k/l`.
4) Use **overview** (`Mod+Tab`) to see the whole layout.
5) Use **jump** (`Mod+/`) to instantly target any window.

If that feels good, you already know 80% of daily navigation.

## Core Concepts (Short Version)

- **Overview** is your map. Use it constantly.
- **Jump** is your teleport. Use it when you lose a window.
- **Spaces** are snapshots of a full layout.
- **Trails** are a “recent/history” layer for windows.
- **Workspaces** exist, but Scroll is happiest when you stay in one and shape it.

## Practical Patterns

- **One workspace, multiple flows**: open everything, then use overview + jump.
- **Save a task**: enter spaces mode (`Mod+g`), then `Shift+1` to save.
- **Return to a task**: `Mod+g`, then `1` to load.
- **Keep a background app**: send to scratchpad (`Mod+Shift+z`), recall (`Mod+z`).

## Essential Keybinds (Daily Use)

- `Mod+Return`: terminal
- `Mod+Space`: launcher (DMS spotlight)
- `Mod+h/j/k/l`: focus
- `Mod+Ctrl+h/j/k/l`: move window
- `Mod+Tab`: overview
- `Mod+/`: jump
- `Mod+Shift+r`: resize mode
- `Mod+f`: fullscreen
- `Mod+Shift+f`: floating toggle
- `Mod+z` / `Mod+Shift+z`: scratchpad show/send

## Layout Control

- `Mod+[ / Mod+]`: switch layout orientation (h/v).
- `Mod+Shift+\`: split workspace (then choose ratio).
- `Mod+w`: fit/align mode for smarter sizing.

## When to Use Workspaces

Use them for hard separation (e.g., gaming vs work). Otherwise, prefer:
overview + jump + spaces.
